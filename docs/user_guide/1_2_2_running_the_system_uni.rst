Starting the hand driver
========================

* **Shadow Hand Driver**
  Launch the driver for the Shadow Hand using the desktop icon ``Launch Shadow Right Hand``,``Launch Shadow Left Hand`` or ``Launch Shadow Bimanual Hands`` depending of your product.

  If you want to launch the hand locally on the server pc (not recommended), plug in the hand ethernet adapter to the laptop and use the Shadow Advanced Launchers folder icon - ``Launch Local Shadow Right Hand``, ``Launch Local Shadow Left Hand`` ``Launch Local Shadow Bimanual Hands``.

* **Lights in the hand**:
  When the ROS driver is running you should see the following lights on the Palm:

  ========================   =============       ================    =================================
  Light                      Colour              Activity            Meaning
  ========================   =============       ================    =================================
  Run                        Green               On                  Hand is in Operational state
  CAN1/2 Transmit            Blue                V.fast flicker      Demand values are being sent to the motors
  CAN1/2 Receive             Blue                V.fast flicker      Motors are sending sensor data
  Joint sensor chip select   Yellow              On                  Sensors being sampled
  ========================   =============       ================    =================================

  After killing the driver, the lights will be in a new state:

  ========================   =============       ================    =================================
  Light                      Colour              Activity            Meaning
  ========================   =============       ================    =================================
  Run                        Green               Blinking            Hand is in Pre-Operational state
  CAN1/2 Transmit            Blue                Off                 No messages transmitted on CAN 1/2
  CAN1/2 Receive             Blue                Off                 No messages received on CAN 1/2
  Joint sensor chip select   Yellow              Off                 Sensors not being sampled

Teamviewer
----------

Teamviewer is software that allows for remote control and desktop sharing between computers. It can be a useful tool for debugging so that Shadow can see exactly what is happening on the server and help to solve any issues. We now install it on servers supplied by Shadow, but it is easily downloaded here:

#. Once you share these details with a member of our support team, they will have access to control your computer remotely. Please note you must have a working internet connection for Teamviewer to work. They will be able to see your desktop and any programs you have running, and have control over the mouse. You **will not lose control** and can interrupt the session at any time by closing the Teamviewer application.

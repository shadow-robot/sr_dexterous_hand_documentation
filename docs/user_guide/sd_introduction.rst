Our systems work within the ROS framework. 

"ROS is an open-source, meta-operating system for your robot. It provides the services you would expect from an 
operating system, including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used 
functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management. It also provides tools and libraries for 
obtaining, building, writing, and running code across multiple computers."_ - ROS.org

You can find the fundamental ROS concepts explained `here <http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Concepts>`_ and a technical overview of the implementation of ROS `here <http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Technical%20Overview>`_.

If you are unfamiliar with ROS and intend to use the ROS API, you can find the fundamental ROS concepts explained `here <http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Concepts>`_ and a technical overview of the implementation of ROS `here <http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Technical%20Overview>`_.
It is highly recommended that you also check the `ROS Tutorials <http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials>`_.

If you are unfamiliar with Linux and its terminal on Linux, you should look `here <https://askubuntu.com/questions/183775/how-do-i-open-a-terminal>`_.

Shadow software is deployed using Docker. Docker is a container framework where each container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run it. It is similar to a virtual machine but with much less overhead. You can find more information `here <https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/>`_.

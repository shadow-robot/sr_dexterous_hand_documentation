Inspecting for wear and tear
----------------------------

There are three types of wear and tear that might happen to your hand over the course of its use.
**Settling:** Parts and fittings may settle over time. In particular, tendons may stretch slightly, and the spools on the motors may shift, increasing the amount of slack in the system. This can be remedied by re-tensioning the tendons. Hall effect sensors may shift in position slightly. This may be remedied by re-calibrating the joint.

**Wearing:** In use, some tendons are subject to wear. In particular, wherever a tendon travels over a pulley, it may show signs of wear, appearing slightly fluffy. Normally, this isn't a problem, but if excessive wear is apparent, then the tendon might need to be changed.

**Failing:** As many parts of the hand are subject to very high loads at times, it is possible for some parts to fail. The exact symptoms of the failure depend on the particular part in question. Most such failures will need to be fixed by service personnel.

 Re-tensioning
 -------------
From time to time, you may find that the amount of slack in the tendons has increased, causing backlash and deteriorating the control. The tendons can be re-tightened at the motor.

Look at the Motor Layout diagram in this document to find the position of the motor that needs tightening. Using the green hex driver, remove the black motor cover; you can unplug the fan.
